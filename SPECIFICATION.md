# Prompter: Task-Driven Development Specification

## 1. Introduction

This specification document outlines the Task-Driven Development (TDD) approach implemented in the Prompter project. Prompter is a command-line interface designed to enhance prompt engineering through reinforcement learning, standardized responses, and secure communications. This document defines the architectural principles, design decisions, and implementation guidelines that drive the development of Prompter.

## 2. Task-Driven Architecture: Core Principles

### 2.1 Foundational Principles

Task-Driven Development is built on the following core principles:

1. **Task Centricity**: All functionality is organized around specific tasks rather than objects or services.
2. **Autonomous Task Resolution**: Each task contains the necessary logic to resolve itself or delegate to appropriate sub-tasks.
3. **Continuous Learning**: Tasks improve through feedback and adaptation.
4. **Contextual Awareness**: Tasks maintain awareness of their execution context.
5. **Secure Communication**: All inter-task communication is encrypted and authenticated.

### 2.2 Key Differentiators

Task-Driven Architecture differs from traditional paradigms in several fundamental ways:

| Traditional Paradigm | Task-Driven Architecture |
|----------------------|--------------------------|
| Object-centric | Task-centric |
| Static behavior | Self-improving behavior |
| Passive components | Autonomous agents |
| Fixed workflows | Adaptive workflows |
| Explicit dependencies | Contextual dependencies |
| External orchestration | Self-orchestration |

## 3. AI/ML Integration

### 3.1 Reinforcement Learning Core

Unlike traditional architectures where ML is an optional add-on, Prompter integrates reinforcement learning as a fundamental architectural component:

- **Pattern Recognition**: Tasks automatically identify patterns in user interactions
- **Self-Optimization**: Tasks evolve their behavior based on success metrics
- **Continuous Training**: The system improves during normal operation
- **Transfer Learning**: Knowledge gained in one task domain transfers to others

### 3.2 LLM Interaction Model

Prompter introduces a new interaction paradigm with large language models:

1. **Bidirectional Learning**: LLMs both provide solutions and learn from task executions
2. **Prompt Evolution**: Prompts evolve through reinforcement learning
3. **Context Preservation**: Task context is maintained across interactions
4. **Multi-modal Integration**: Tasks can leverage various LLM capabilities seamlessly

## 4. System Architecture

### 4.1 Core Components

The Prompter system consists of several key components organized around the task-driven paradigm:

1. **Logging Module**: Centralized, secure logging with context preservation
2. **Websocket Module**: Secure bidirectional communication between tasks
3. **Test Reporting Module**: Task-specific testing and validation
4. **RL Model Module**: Core reinforcement learning capabilities
5. **Pattern Recognition Module**: Identifies and leverages recurring patterns
6. **CLI Module**: User interaction and task initiation

### 4.2 Task Execution Flow

1. **Task Initiation**: Tasks are initiated via CLI commands or other tasks
2. **Context Acquisition**: Tasks acquire necessary context
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Relevant patterns are identified
4. **Execution Strategy**: RL model determines optimal execution path
5. **Execution**: Task executes with continuous feedback
6. **Learning**: Results are fed back to improve future executions
7. **Reporting**: Execution metrics are reported

## 5. Implementation Guidelines

### 5.1 Task Definition Standard

Tasks within Prompter follow a standardized definition format:

```python
class Task:
    def __init__(self, context, parameters):
        self.context = context
        self.parameters = parameters
        self.subtasks = []
        self.history = []
        
    def execute(self):
        # Task-specific execution logic
        pass
        
    def learn(self, result, feedback):
        # Update internal model based on execution results
        pass
```

### 5.2 Pattern Recognition Implementation

Patterns are represented as templates with variables that can be extracted and matched:

```python
class PromptPattern:
    def __init__(self, template, variables=None, score=0.0):
        self.template = template
        self.variables = variables or self._extract_variables(template)
        self.score = score
        
    def render(self, **kwargs):
        # Render template with provided variables
        pass
        
    def _extract_variables(self, template):
        # Extract variables from template
        pass
```

### 5.3 Reinforcement Learning Integration

Each task leverages the RL model for decision-making:

```python
class PromptRL:
    def __init__(self, input_size=768, hidden_size=256, output_size=64):
        # Initialize RL model
        pass
        
    def add_to_memory(self, pattern, reward):
        # Add pattern to memory for training
        pass
        
    def train(self, epochs=10, batch_size=32):
        # Train model on collected memory
        pass
        
    def predict(self, pattern):
        # Predict reward for a pattern
        pass
```

## 6. Paradigm Shift

### 6.1 From Static to Adaptive Applications

Task-Driven Development represents a fundamental shift from static, pre-defined applications to adaptive systems that:

1. **Learn from Usage**: Improve functionality based on actual use patterns
2. **Self-Optimize**: Adjust internal processes without developer intervention
3. **Adapt to User**: Personalize interactions based on individual user patterns
4. **Evolve Capabilities**: Develop new capabilities through pattern recognition

### 6.2 From Development to Evolution

The development lifecycle shifts from traditional build-deploy-maintain to:

1. **Seed**: Provide initial capabilities and learning framework
2. **Nurture**: Support with feedback and training data
3. **Grow**: Allow system to develop new capabilities
4. **Prune**: Guide growth direction through constraints and objectives
5. **Harvest**: Extract learned patterns for broader application

## 7. Benefits

### 7.1 Development Benefits

1. **Reduced Maintenance**: Self-improving systems require less manual updating
2. **Focused Testing**: Testing centers on task effectiveness rather than implementation details
3. **Scalable Complexity**: Systems can grow in complexity organically
4. **Transferable Knowledge**: Patterns learned in one context benefit others

### 7.2 User Benefits

1. **Personalized Experience**: Interactions adapt to individual users
2. **Improving Performance**: System becomes more effective over time
3. **Reduced Training**: System adapts to users rather than requiring users to adapt to it
4. **Context Preservation**: System maintains awareness of user context across interactions

## 8. Security Considerations

Task-Driven Architecture introduces unique security concerns:

1. **Learning Poisoning**: Malicious feedback could corrupt task learning
2. **Pattern Leakage**: Learned patterns might inadvertently contain sensitive information
3. **Autonomous Behavior**: Tasks might develop unexpected behaviors

The Prompter architecture addresses these through:

1. **Encrypted Storage**: All learned patterns are stored with encryption
2. **Bounded Autonomy**: Clear constraints on task behavior
3. **Validation Gates**: Learning passes through validation before adoption
4. **Secure Communication**: All inter-task communication is encrypted

## 9. Roadmap

The implementation of Prompter follows a phased approach:

1. **Foundation Phase**: Core module development with TDD approach
2. **Integration Phase**: Connecting modules into cohesive system
3. **Learning Phase**: Training initial models and establishing baseline
4. **Expansion Phase**: Adding additional task types and capabilities
5. **Optimization Phase**: Refining learning models and improving efficiency

## 10. Conclusion

Task-Driven Development represents a paradigm shift in application architecture, positioning AI/ML capabilities at the core rather than as peripheral features. By centering development around autonomous, self-improving tasks, Prompter demonstrates how applications can evolve beyond static implementations into adaptive systems that continuously improve through normal use.

The Prompter project serves as both a useful tool for prompt engineering and a reference implementation of Task-Driven Architecture principles, showcasing how this approach can create more resilient, adaptive, and effective applications.
